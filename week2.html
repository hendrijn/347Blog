    <h2>CSS and The Box Model</h2>

    <p>
      We have now begun looking at ways to style and align HTML. I had some
      previous experiences in both of these categories but there's always room
      to learn some new information and little rules. The first thing I realized
      was there is another way to style code segments. Last week I used the
      &lt;pre&gt; tag, which was not inline with the other text. I looked into
      this issue and
      <a
        href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36781075/css-inline-a-pre-tag"
        >found</a
      >
      the &lt;code&gt; tag which solved the issue. So now, I can turn &quot;It
      told me to use the relative URL in the href=&quot;&quot; attribute.&quot;
      into &quot;It told me to use the relative URL in the
      <code>href =&quot;&quot;</code> attribute. This still looks a bit ugly so
      let me add some CSS to make the quotes from last week stand out a bit
      more...

      <span
        >So now, I can turn
        <span id="quote"
          >&quot;It told me to use the relative URL in the href=&quot;&quot;
          attribute.&quot;</span
        >
        into
        <span id="quote"
          >&quot;It told me to use the relative URL in the
          <code>href =&quot;&quot;</code> attribute.</span
        ></span
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      I also wanted to make a few changes on this site based on the readings.
      First I set the width of the pages to be 960px so the text doesn't go all
      the way to the edge of the page. I also centered the text by setting the
      left and right margins to auto. This makes the page look a lot more
      readable, but I also added a border and shadow around the title to make it
      stand out.

      In addition, I updated the home page to be more welcoming and prettier.
      When I was doing this, I wanted to remove the color changing between the
      links.
      <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_link.asp" target="_blank"
        >This W3Schools article</a
      >
      describes how to change the link states link, visited, hover, and active.
      I set the visited state to be <code>a:link { color: navy; }</code>. Now, I
      know that the theme and styling isn't consistant, but that's on purpose to
      try out different techniques. And hey, Dr. Johnson isn't grading for
      design... yet anyway :).

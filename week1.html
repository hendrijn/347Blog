    <h2>New Beginnings in HTML</h2>

    <p>
      It's exciting getting into a class where the main focus is web
      development. I did a few LinkedIn learning courses over the summer in the
      3 main languages, but I still have more to learn. This week was full of
      knowledge surrounding HTML and it's semantic meaning. The in class labs
      brought about some questions that I looked up and found helpful resources
      for. Here's a few of my findings.

        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp" target="_blank">This W3Schools article</a> describes how to use HTML links to reference another file in the repository. I needed this to setup the home page because I was unsure how to link the different weeks. It told me to use the relative URL in the href=&quot;&quot; attribute. Here's what I used to actually link to this page: <pre>&lt;a href=&quot;/week1.html&quot;&gt;</pre>
    </p>

        Another thing I needed to research was if there was a date input type. In the lab, Carter and I made a diner menu and wanted the user to input the time at which they were coming in to pick up their order. <a href="https://geeksforgeeks.org/html-time-tag/" target="_blank">GeeksforGeeks</a> had a great article describing what the time tag does and how to use it with real code samples. It's cool seeing all the different ways you can ask users for inupt. Here's an example of how we used it in the lab: <pre>&lt;h3&gt;What time are you coming in?&lt;/h3&gt;<br>&lt;label&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;time&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;</pre><br>which ended up looking like this:
            <div>
                <h3>What time are you coming in?</h3>
                <label><input type="time" /></label>
            </div>
    </p>

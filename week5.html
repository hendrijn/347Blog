    <h2>Simple JS Project</h2>

    <p>
      Now that I dove into some Javascript for the static website, I wanted to
      research some other cool things I could do. Over the summer I tried to
      learn about using javascript, but it got complicated really fast. I found
      <a href="https://jsbeginners.com/hex-change-background-color-project/"
        >this article from JS beginners</a
      >
      which was part of another post featuring 100ish simple projects to test
      js. I decided to pick the hex color changer because it was actually a
      project I though about doing over the summer. Note that because of how the
      source files are structured, I had to make this in it's
      <a href="week5-result1.html">own html file</a>. Let's give it a try.
    </p>

    <p>
      First thing I needed was a container for the background color to be
      changed in. Creating a div with a h1 text field and a button did the
      trick. Now, the project uses a lot of bootstrap and jquery which I didn't
      really want to get into, so I downloaded it from the github repo linked in
      the article. Once that was set up, I began figuring out the js to make the
      app run. This code is in the .app file.
    </p>

    <p>
      I gather from using JS so far that methods are things called functions. So
      I knew I would need a function with something inside. I knew that the
      button, body, and hex value were going to play a key role so I needed to
      add them to the function. I remembered from the allover reading that
      variables are called const. Using the querySelector function I was able to
      grab the #btn id from the html document. I repeated the process for the
      others. Now, my js file looked like this:
    </p>

    <pre>
        function(){
            const button = document.querySelector('#btn');
            const body = document.querySelector('body');
            const value = document.querySelector('#hex-value');
        }
    </pre>

    <p>
      I remembered that in order to make the buttons do something, I would set
      an event listener on the button, and send it another function that would
      actually change the background color. Now my body looks like this:
    </p>

    <pre>
        function(){
            const button = document.querySelector('#btn');
            const body = document.querySelector('body');
            const value = document.querySelector('#hex-value');
    
            button.addEventListener('click', changeColor);
    
            function changeColor(){
            
            }
        }
        </pre
    >

    <p>
      At this point, I had no idea how to get the hex value and assign it to the
      body so I looked at the source code. There I saw the need to create a
      const for all the values that compose a hex number. I then saw a loop
      which was confusing until I remembered that all hex numbers have 6 values.
      So I knew the loop was generating 6 random values to be the new hex color
      for the page.
    </p>

    <p>
      So then I decided to change the functionality of this site to let the user
      specify what hex value they wanted to use. I made the js all by myself. I
      knew from the previous solution that the
      <code>.textContent</code> function grabbed whatever was inside the
      specified element. So I modified the page to create a text input for
      people to type in a code. Then I reassigned the hex variable to be the
      pound symbol plus the textContent of the input. But this didn't work as I
      intended so I Googled how to get the value of a text input and found this
      method instead:
    </p>
    <pre>
      hex = '#' + document.querySelector('input').value;
    </pre>

    <p>
      This worked!!! To see the modified version of the site,
      <a href="week5-result2.html"> click here.</a> Be aware there's no
      validation and the pound symbol is not required in the input.
